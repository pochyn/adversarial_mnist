Adversarial image and probability after iteration 1:

Original label: 2; Original probability: 88.56145143508911 New label: 6; New probability with fake label: 76.18929743766785  
  
  
Adversarial image and probability after iteration 2:

Original label: 2; Original probability: 88.56145143508911 New label: 6; New probability with fake label: 98.51791262626648     
  
Adversarial image and probability after iteration 3:

Original label: 2; Original probability: 88.56145143508911 New label: 6; New probability with fake label: 99.8832643032074      
  
Adversarial image and probability after iteration 4:

Original label: 2; Original probability: 88.56145143508911 New label: 6; New probability with fake label: 99.9846339225769      
  
Adversarial image and probability after iteration 5:  
![alt text](https://github.com/pochyn/adversarial_mnist/blob/master/iter5.PNG)  
Original label: 2; Original probability: 88.56145143508911 New label: 6; New probability with fake label: 99.9977707862854  
  
    
So after iteration 5 our CNN is confident on 99.997% that number 2 is actually number 6
